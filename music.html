        “Music is the universal language of mankind.”
        –Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</pre>
        
        <pre>
            A self-taught musician, Joshua started making beats at age 14, starting with 
            a simple drum rhythm, and never looked back. Not long after, his dad gave him 
            a choice. Learn piano or learn guitar. Joshua chose piano. The next day upon 
            returning from Joshua's grandpa's, his dad gave him a guitar from his grandpa. 
            There, a journey started.

            A couple thousand dollars and nearly 5 years later, 
            Joshua now makes music for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbyCaJwdma0WQupQXJPDmbA">YouTube channel</a> where he has nearly 7000 views while also 
            interning at a local recording studio in his hometown in addition to playing guitar, bass, and piano.</pre>
