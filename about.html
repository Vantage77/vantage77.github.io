        <p class="preHead">Tucked away, he creates from the darkness</p>
        <p>
            <br><br>Growing up in an unheralded city, Joshua loves 
            to create out of nothing and share it with those 
            who care.
        
            Blessed to be raised in a stable home, Joshua was able to foster
            two main passions. Technology and Music. Taking after his dad, he
            is pursuing a degree in IT, having interned at a computer repair
            shop in high school and have the chance to build and upgrade desktop
            and laptop systems.
        
            On the side, Joshua has dived into the world of music, this time
            following the path of both parents and grandfather by being a part
            of his church band. Predating that, he got started making his own
            music on his computer at the age of 14, self teaching through 
            YouTube videos and he took what he learned and applied it towards
            teaching himself guitar, bass, and piano as well.
