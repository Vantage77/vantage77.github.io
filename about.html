    Growing up in an unheralded city, Joshua loves 
    to create out of nothing and share it with those 
    who care.

    Blessed to be raised in a stable home, Joshua was able to foster
    two main passions. Technology and Music. Taking after his dad, he
    is pursuing a degree in IT, having interned at a computer repair
    shop in high school and have the chance to build and upgrade desktop
    and laptop systems.

    On the side, Joshua has dived into the world of music, this time
    following the path of both parents and grandfather by being a part
    of his church band. Predating that, he got started making his own
    music on his computer at the age of 14, self teaching through 
    YouTube videos and he took what he learned and applied it towards
    teaching himself guitar, bass, and piano as well.
